# Recipe App

The Ruby on Rails capstone project is a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

The application allows the user to:

- Register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- Introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- See the money spent on each category.
